This is the [FreedomSponsors](http://www.freedomsponsors.org) "SponsorThis"
plugin for [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/).

When installed, it will add a nice, discrete "Sponsor this" link on your
Bugzilla's bug pages, just below the "Importance" bit.

The link leads to a FreedomSponsors page where the user can place a bounty for
that bug.

To install it, just get the latest version .tar.gz package from the
[download section](https://github.com/Wurblzap/freedomsponsors-bugzilla-plugin/downloads)
and extract the package's contents into the "extensions" subdirectory of your
Bugzilla installation, so that inside the "extensions" directory there is a
new directory called FreedomSponsors with some content.
